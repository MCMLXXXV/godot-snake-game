# Snake Game â€¢ [![made with Godot 3.1][badge]][godot]

Hi! This was my first stab at a full game project made with Godot, so bear with me. After reading many tutorials to get the hang of it, I needed something quick and easy to practice the stuff I've just learned. Because I'm a "very" creative person, [I ended making the same thing again](https://github.com/rblopes/phaser-3-snake-game).

This project is shared under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE.md), so everyone else starting with Godot can learn something or two from it. It's not perfect, could use a few improvements here and there, but I'm happy with the result. I hope you will enjoy it.
