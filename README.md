# It's Snake Game, but everytime you play it... â€¢ [![made with Godot 3.1][badge]][godot]

...it gets more boring!

Hi! This is my first stab at a full game project made with Godot, so bear with me. After reading many tutorials to get the hang of it, I needed something quick and easy to practice the stuff I've learned the past couple of months. It happens that I'm a "very" creative person, so, well... looks like [I'm doing the same thing again](https://github.com/rblopes/phaser-3-snake-game).

This project is shared under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE.md), so everyone else who are starting with Godot can learn something or two from it. It's not perfect, could use a few little improvements here and there, but I'm happy with the result so far. I hope you will enjoy it.
